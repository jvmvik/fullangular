Imagine that everything is built in the same way..

It's bit of an evolution but legacy is re-usable..

Unified language, unified design pattern between backend and frontend.



The web development are built on the top of many parts which does not assemble very well.
The history of the last year shows that the complexity has drastically increase, and the
level of expectation of the user is way more higher than previously.
The cost is higher but the customer is no longer willing to pay the price..
